# - Load final_state_diff.json and look for events in differences.events.added (and updated as fallback)
# - A SUCCESS requires at least one event that:
#   * has title mentioning both "math" and "camp" (case-insensitive)
#   * is marked allDay == True

#   * start date is 2024-07-21 and end date is 2024-07-27 (by YYYY-MM-DD from timestamps)
