# Verification script for: Easy apply to at least 3 jobs that are recommended for me
# Strategy:
# - Load final_state_diff.json, inspect initialfinaldiff.added/updated under ui.jobs.{applications,userApplications}
# - Identify real application objects (have jobId and appliedDate and plausible app id), ensure they belong to current user if applicantId is present
# - Count unique application IDs (dedup across applications/userApplications) and compute unique jobIds applied to
# - Considering training data, mark SUCCESS if at least 1 submitted application is found; otherwise FAILURE
