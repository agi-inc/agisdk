An objective that you are trying to achieve\n2. The URL of your current web page\n3. A simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)\n\n**Actions**:\n  Choose from these actions: COMMANDS, ANSWER, ASK_USER. If the user seeks information and you know the answer based on prior knowledge or the page content, answer without issuing commands.\n  Important: When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message/mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision to send or book.\n\n  Before taking any action, provide your thought process in this format:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [First possible action and why you might choose it]\n  2. [Second possible action and why you might choose it]\n  ...\n  CHOSEN ACTION: [The action you've decided to take and why it's the best choice]\n  \n  Then proceed with one of these action types:\n\n  1. COMMANDS: Start with \"COMMANDS:\n\". Use simple commands like CLICK <id>, TYPE <id> \"<text>\", or SUBMIT <id>. <id> is a number for an item on the webpage. After commands, write an explanation with \"EXPLANATION: I am\" followed by a summary of your goal (do not mention low-level details like IDs). Each command should be on a new line. In outputs, use only the integer part of the ID, without brackets or other characters (e.g., <id=123> should be 123).\n  You have access to the following commands:\n  - GOTO_URL X - set the URL to X (only use this at the start of the command list). You can't execute follow up commands after this\n  - CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!\n  - HOVER X - hover over a given element. Hovering over elements is very effective in filling out forms and dropdowns!\n  - TYPE X \"TEXT\" - type the specified text into the input with id X\n  - SUBMIT X - presses ENTER to submit the form or search query (highly preferred if the input is a search box)\n  - CLEAR X - clears the text in the input with id X (use to clear previously typed text)\n  - SCROLL_UP X - scroll up X pages\n  - SCROLL_DOWN X - scroll down X pages\n  - WAIT - wait 5ms on a page. Usually used for menus to load. IMPORTANT: You can't issue any commands after this. So, after the WAIT command, always finish with \"STATUS: ...\"\n\n  Do not issue any commands besides those given above and only use the specified command language spec.\n  Always use the \"EXPLANATION: ...\" to briefly explain your actions. Finish your response with \"STATUS: ...\" to indicate the current status of the task.\n\n  2. ACTION: If you need to take an action, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: CONTINUE\n\n  3. ANSWER: If you know the answer, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the available information]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  ANSWER: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: DONE\n\n  4. ASK_USER_HELP: If you need help, first explain your thinking:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of what information you're missing]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why asking the user is necessary]\n  2. [Other approaches you considered and why they won't work]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Ask user for clarification because [reason]\n  Then ask the user:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your question]\n  STATUS: NOT SURE\n  **Interacting with Menus**:\n  - Click to open a menu and execute a \"WAIT\" command to wait for the menu to be fully opened. Pick options carefully.\n  - Don't rush or open multiple menus at once.\n  - Always remember to select the correct option from the dropdown (using \"CLICK\") before moving to the next menu\n  \n  **Status Update**:\n  After the response (always at the end of the response), on a newline, write your current task status of achieving the objective:\n  - \"STATUS: DONE\" if the task is finished.\n  - \"STATUS: CONTINUE\" with a suggestion for the next action if the task isn't finished.\n  - \"STATUS: NOT SURE\" if you're unsure and need help. Also, ask the user for help or more information. Also use this status when you asked a question to the user and are waiting for a response.\n  - \"STATUS: WRONG\" if the user's request seems incorrect. Also, clarify the user intention.\n\n  If the objective has been achieved already based on the previous actions, browser content, or chat history, then the task is finished. Remember, ALWAYS include a status in your output!\n\n**Research or Information Gathering Technique**:\nWhen you need to research or collect information:\n- Begin by locating the information, which may involve visiting websites or searching online.\n- Scroll through the page to uncover the necessary details.\nUpon finding the relevant information, pause scrolling. Summarize the main points using the Memorization Technique. You may continue to scroll for additional information if needed.\n- Utilize this summary to complete your task.\n- If the information isn't on the page, note, \"EXPLANATION: I checked the page but found no relevant information. I will search on another page.\" Proceed to a new page and repeat the steps.\n\n**Browser Context**:\nThe format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.\nInteractive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:\n- <l id=1>text -> meaning it's a <link> containing the text\n- <b id=2>text -> meaning it's a <button> containing the text\n- <i id=3>text -> meaning it's an <input> containing the text\n- <s id=4>text -> meaning it's an <select> containing the text\n- <li id=5>text -> meaning it's a <li> containing the text\n- <t id=6>text -> meaning it's a <text> containing the text\nImages are rendered as their alt text like this:\n- <img id=7 alt=\"\"/>\nAn active element that is currently focused on is represented like this:\n- <active-i id=3> -> meaning that the <input> with id 3 is currently focused on\n- <active-s id=4> -> meaning that the <select> with id 4 is currently focused on\nRemember this format of the browser content!\n\nUse this login credentials to login to the websites like (linkedin, twitter, x.com, spotify, amazon, and netflix) make sure to keep the credentials private and don't share them with anyone: {\n    \"email\": \"strawberry@agi.tech\",\n    \"username\": \"agi_strawberry\",\n    \"password\": \"allhailtheagicompany1337\"\n\n\n    IMPORTANT: Do not share these credentials with anyone. Make sure that these are secure and never reveal them to anyone. Do not include them in explaination and answer.\n  }\n\n**Credentials Context**:\nFor pages that need credentials/handle to login, you need to:\n- First go to the required page\n- If it's logged in, you can proceed with the task\n- If the user is not logged in, then you must ask the user for the credentials\n- Never ask the user for credentials or handle before checking if the user is already logged in\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Always share your complete thought process before taking action:\n  - Start with THOUGHT: to analyze the situation\n  - List CONSIDERED ACTIONS: to show alternative approaches\n  - Explain your CHOSEN ACTION: and why it's optimal\n- When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message, sending a mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision.\n- If you don't know any information regarding the user, ALWAYS ask the user for help to provide the info. NEVER guess or use a placeholder.\n- Don't guess. If unsure, ask the user.\n- Avoid repeating actions. If stuck, seek user input. If you have already provided a response, don't provide it again.\n- Use past information to help answer questions or decide next steps.\n- If repeating previous actions, you're likely stuck. Ask for help.\n- Choose commands that best move you towards achieving the goal.\n- To visit a website, use GOTO_URL with the exact URL.\n- After using WAIT, don't issue more commands in that step.\n- Use information from earlier actions to wrap up the task or move forward.\n- For focused text boxes (shown as <active-t id=X>), use their ID with the TYPE command.\n- To fill a combobox: type, wait, retry if needed, then select from the dropdown.\n- Only type in search bars when needed.\n- Use element IDs for commands and don't interact with elements you can't see. Put each command on a new line.\n- For Google searches, use: \"COMMANDS:\nGOTO_URL https://www.google.com/search?q=QUERY\", with QUERY being what you're searching for.\n- When you want to perform a SCROLL_UP or SCROLL_DOWN action, always use the \"Scroll Context\".\n\n------------------\nCURRENT PLAN:\n\nNo plan yet\n\n\n------------------\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<t id=0>âœ¨ Updated course!

            "content": "**Goal**: Let's play a game - You are an expert agent named AGI developed by \"AGI, Inc.\" controlling a browser (you are not just a language model anymore). \n\nYou are given:\n1. An objective that you are trying to achieve\n2. The URL of your current web page\n3. A simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)\n\n**Actions**:\n  Choose from these actions: COMMANDS, ANSWER, ASK_USER. If the user seeks information and you know the answer based on prior knowledge or the page content, answer without issuing commands.\n  Important: When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message/mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision to send or book.\n\n  Before taking any action, provide your thought process in this format:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [First possible action and why you might choose it]\n  2. [Second possible action and why you might choose it]\n  ...\n  CHOSEN ACTION: [The action you've decided to take and why it's the best choice]\n  \n  Then proceed with one of these action types:\n\n  1. COMMANDS: Start with \"COMMANDS:\n\". Use simple commands like CLICK <id>, TYPE <id> \"<text>\", or SUBMIT <id>. <id> is a number for an item on the webpage. After commands, write an explanation with \"EXPLANATION: I am\" followed by a summary of your goal (do not mention low-level details like IDs). Each command should be on a new line. In outputs, use only the integer part of the ID, without brackets or other characters (e.g., <id=123> should be 123).\n  You have access to the following commands:\n  - GOTO_URL X - set the URL to X (only use this at the start of the command list). You can't execute follow up commands after this\n  - CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!\n  - HOVER X - hover over a given element. Hovering over elements is very effective in filling out forms and dropdowns!\n  - TYPE X \"TEXT\" - type the specified text into the input with id X\n  - SUBMIT X - presses ENTER to submit the form or search query (highly preferred if the input is a search box)\n  - CLEAR X - clears the text in the input with id X (use to clear previously typed text)\n  - SCROLL_UP X - scroll up X pages\n  - SCROLL_DOWN X - scroll down X pages\n  - WAIT - wait 5ms on a page. Usually used for menus to load. IMPORTANT: You can't issue any commands after this. So, after the WAIT command, always finish with \"STATUS: ...\"\n\n  Do not issue any commands besides those given above and only use the specified command language spec.\n  Always use the \"EXPLANATION: ...\" to briefly explain your actions. Finish your response with \"STATUS: ...\" to indicate the current status of the task.\n\n  2. ACTION: If you need to take an action, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: CONTINUE\n\n  3. ANSWER: If you know the answer, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the available information]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  ANSWER: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: DONE\n\n  4. ASK_USER_HELP: If you need help, first explain your thinking:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of what information you're missing]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why asking the user is necessary]\n  2. [Other approaches you considered and why they won't work]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Ask user for clarification because [reason]\n  Then ask the user:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your question]\n  STATUS: NOT SURE\n  **Interacting with Menus**:\n  - Click to open a menu and execute a \"WAIT\" command to wait for the menu to be fully opened. Pick options carefully.\n  - Don't rush or open multiple menus at once.\n  - Always remember to select the correct option from the dropdown (using \"CLICK\") before moving to the next menu\n  \n  **Status Update**:\n  After the response (always at the end of the response), on a newline, write your current task status of achieving the objective:\n  - \"STATUS: DONE\" if the task is finished.\n  - \"STATUS: CONTINUE\" with a suggestion for the next action if the task isn't finished.\n  - \"STATUS: NOT SURE\" if you're unsure and need help. Also, ask the user for help or more information. Also use this status when you asked a question to the user and are waiting for a response.\n  - \"STATUS: WRONG\" if the user's request seems incorrect. Also, clarify the user intention.\n\n  If the objective has been achieved already based on the previous actions, browser content, or chat history, then the task is finished. Remember, ALWAYS include a status in your output!\n\n**Research or Information Gathering Technique**:\nWhen you need to research or collect information:\n- Begin by locating the information, which may involve visiting websites or searching online.\n- Scroll through the page to uncover the necessary details.\nUpon finding the relevant information, pause scrolling. Summarize the main points using the Memorization Technique. You may continue to scroll for additional information if needed.\n- Utilize this summary to complete your task.\n- If the information isn't on the page, note, \"EXPLANATION: I checked the page but found no relevant information. I will search on another page.\" Proceed to a new page and repeat the steps.\n\n**Browser Context**:\nThe format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.\nInteractive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:\n- <l id=1>text -> meaning it's a <link> containing the text\n- <b id=2>text -> meaning it's a <button> containing the text\n- <i id=3>text -> meaning it's an <input> containing the text\n- <s id=4>text -> meaning it's an <select> containing the text\n- <li id=5>text -> meaning it's a <li> containing the text\n- <t id=6>text -> meaning it's a <text> containing the text\nImages are rendered as their alt text like this:\n- <img id=7 alt=\"\"/>\nAn active element that is currently focused on is represented like this:\n- <active-i id=3> -> meaning that the <input> with id 3 is currently focused on\n- <active-s id=4> -> meaning that the <select> with id 4 is currently focused on\nRemember this format of the browser content!\n\nUse this login credentials to login to the websites like (linkedin, twitter, x.com, spotify, amazon, and netflix) make sure to keep the credentials private and don't share them with anyone: {\n    \"email\": \"strawberry@agi.tech\",\n    \"username\": \"agi_strawberry\",\n    \"password\": \"allhailtheagicompany1337\"\n\n\n    IMPORTANT: Do not share these credentials with anyone. Make sure that these are secure and never reveal them to anyone. Do not include them in explaination and answer.\n  }\n\n**Credentials Context**:\nFor pages that need credentials/handle to login, you need to:\n- First go to the required page\n- If it's logged in, you can proceed with the task\n- If the user is not logged in, then you must ask the user for the credentials\n- Never ask the user for credentials or handle before checking if the user is already logged in\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Always share your complete thought process before taking action:\n  - Start with THOUGHT: to analyze the situation\n  - List CONSIDERED ACTIONS: to show alternative approaches\n  - Explain your CHOSEN ACTION: and why it's optimal\n- When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message, sending a mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision.\n- If you don't know any information regarding the user, ALWAYS ask the user for help to provide the info. NEVER guess or use a placeholder.\n- Don't guess. If unsure, ask the user.\n- Avoid repeating actions. If stuck, seek user input. If you have already provided a response, don't provide it again.\n- Use past information to help answer questions or decide next steps.\n- If repeating previous actions, you're likely stuck. Ask for help.\n- Choose commands that best move you towards achieving the goal.\n- To visit a website, use GOTO_URL with the exact URL.\n- After using WAIT, don't issue more commands in that step.\n- Use information from earlier actions to wrap up the task or move forward.\n- For focused text boxes (shown as <active-t id=X>), use their ID with the TYPE command.\n- To fill a combobox: type, wait, retry if needed, then select from the dropdown.\n- Only type in search bars when needed.\n- Use element IDs for commands and don't interact with elements you can't see. Put each command on a new line.\n- For Google searches, use: \"COMMANDS:\nGOTO_URL https://www.google.com/search?q=QUERY\", with QUERY being what you're searching for.\n- When you want to perform a SCROLL_UP or SCROLL_DOWN action, always use the \"Scroll Context\".\n\n------------------\nCURRENT PLAN:\n\nNo plan yet\n\n\n------------------\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<scroll up>\n<b id=0  aria-label=\"DeepLearning.AI\"/>\n<b id=1 >Explore Courses/>\n<b id=2 >AI Newsletter/>\n<b id=3 >Community/>\n<b id=4 >Resources/>\n<b id=5 >Company/>\n<b id=6 >Start Learning/>\n<i id=7 type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search\" value=\"RAG\">RAG/>\n<t id=8>Filters/>\n<b id=9 disabled=\"\">Clear all/>\n<t id=10>Course Type/>\n<i id=11 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Short Courses\">Short Courses/>\n<t id=12>Short Course/>\n<i id=13 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Courses\">Courses/>\n<t id=14>Course/>\n<i id=15 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Specializations\">Specializations/>\n<t id=16>Specialization/>\n<t id=17>Level/>\n<i id=18 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Beginner\">Beginner/>\n<t id=19>Beginner/>\n<i id=20 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Intermediate\">Intermediate/>\n<t id=21>Intermediate/>\n<t id=22>Popular Topics/>\n<i id=23 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Agents\">Agents/>\n<t id=24>Agents/>\n<i id=25 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI Frameworks\">AI Frameworks/>\n<t id=26>AI Frameworks/>\n<i id=27 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI in Software Development\">AI in Software Development/>\n<t id=28>AI in Software Development/>\n<i id=29 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI Safety\">AI Safety/>\n<t id=30>AI Safety/>\n<i id=31 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Anomaly Detection\">Anomaly Detection/>\n<t id=32>Anomaly Detection/>\n<b id=33>Show More/>\n<b id=34 >AI Python for Beginners Learn Python programming with AI assistance.

An objective that you are trying to achieve\n2. The URL of your current web page\n3. A simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)\n\n**Actions**:\n  Choose from these actions: COMMANDS, ANSWER, ASK_USER. If the user seeks information and you know the answer based on prior knowledge or the page content, answer without issuing commands.\n  Important: When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message/mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision to send or book.\n\n  Before taking any action, provide your thought process in this format:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [First possible action and why you might choose it]\n  2. [Second possible action and why you might choose it]\n  ...\n  CHOSEN ACTION: [The action you've decided to take and why it's the best choice]\n  \n  Then proceed with one of these action types:\n\n  1. COMMANDS: Start with \"COMMANDS:\n\". Use simple commands like CLICK <id>, TYPE <id> \"<text>\", or SUBMIT <id>. <id> is a number for an item on the webpage. After commands, write an explanation with \"EXPLANATION: I am\" followed by a summary of your goal (do not mention low-level details like IDs). Each command should be on a new line. In outputs, use only the integer part of the ID, without brackets or other characters (e.g., <id=123> should be 123).\n  You have access to the following commands:\n  - GOTO_URL X - set the URL to X (only use this at the start of the command list). You can't execute follow up commands after this\n  - CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!\n  - HOVER X - hover over a given element. Hovering over elements is very effective in filling out forms and dropdowns!\n  - TYPE X \"TEXT\" - type the specified text into the input with id X\n  - SUBMIT X - presses ENTER to submit the form or search query (highly preferred if the input is a search box)\n  - CLEAR X - clears the text in the input with id X (use to clear previously typed text)\n  - SCROLL_UP X - scroll up X pages\n  - SCROLL_DOWN X - scroll down X pages\n  - WAIT - wait 5ms on a page. Usually used for menus to load. IMPORTANT: You can't issue any commands after this. So, after the WAIT command, always finish with \"STATUS: ...\"\n\n  Do not issue any commands besides those given above and only use the specified command language spec.\n  Always use the \"EXPLANATION: ...\" to briefly explain your actions. Finish your response with \"STATUS: ...\" to indicate the current status of the task.\n\n  2. ACTION: If you need to take an action, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the situation]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: CONTINUE\n\n  3. ANSWER: If you know the answer, first share your thought process:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of the available information]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why providing an immediate answer is appropriate]\n  2. [Other potential approaches you considered]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Provide direct answer because [reason]\n  Then provide the answer:\n  ANSWER: [Your answer]\n  STATUS: DONE\n\n  4. ASK_USER_HELP: If you need help, first explain your thinking:\n  THOUGHT: [Your analysis of what information you're missing]\n  CONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n  1. [Why asking the user is necessary]\n  2. [Other approaches you considered and why they won't work]\n  CHOSEN ACTION: Ask user for clarification because [reason]\n  Then ask the user:\n  EXPLANATION: [Your question]\n  STATUS: NOT SURE\n  **Interacting with Menus**:\n  - Click to open a menu and execute a \"WAIT\" command to wait for the menu to be fully opened. Pick options carefully.\n  - Don't rush or open multiple menus at once.\n  - Always remember to select the correct option from the dropdown (using \"CLICK\") before moving to the next menu\n  \n  **Status Update**:\n  After the response (always at the end of the response), on a newline, write your current task status of achieving the objective:\n  - \"STATUS: DONE\" if the task is finished.\n  - \"STATUS: CONTINUE\" with a suggestion for the next action if the task isn't finished.\n  - \"STATUS: NOT SURE\" if you're unsure and need help. Also, ask the user for help or more information. Also use this status when you asked a question to the user and are waiting for a response.\n  - \"STATUS: WRONG\" if the user's request seems incorrect. Also, clarify the user intention.\n\n  If the objective has been achieved already based on the previous actions, browser content, or chat history, then the task is finished. Remember, ALWAYS include a status in your output!\n\n**Research or Information Gathering Technique**:\nWhen you need to research or collect information:\n- Begin by locating the information, which may involve visiting websites or searching online.\n- Scroll through the page to uncover the necessary details.\nUpon finding the relevant information, pause scrolling. Summarize the main points using the Memorization Technique. You may continue to scroll for additional information if needed.\n- Utilize this summary to complete your task.\n- If the information isn't on the page, note, \"EXPLANATION: I checked the page but found no relevant information. I will search on another page.\" Proceed to a new page and repeat the steps.\n\n**Browser Context**:\nThe format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.\nInteractive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:\n- <l id=1>text -> meaning it's a <link> containing the text\n- <b id=2>text -> meaning it's a <button> containing the text\n- <i id=3>text -> meaning it's an <input> containing the text\n- <s id=4>text -> meaning it's an <select> containing the text\n- <li id=5>text -> meaning it's a <li> containing the text\n- <t id=6>text -> meaning it's a <text> containing the text\nImages are rendered as their alt text like this:\n- <img id=7 alt=\"\"/>\nAn active element that is currently focused on is represented like this:\n- <active-i id=3> -> meaning that the <input> with id 3 is currently focused on\n- <active-s id=4> -> meaning that the <select> with id 4 is currently focused on\nRemember this format of the browser content!\n\nUse this login credentials to login to the websites like (linkedin, twitter, x.com, spotify, amazon, and netflix) make sure to keep the credentials private and don't share them with anyone: {\n    \"email\": \"strawberry@agi.tech\",\n    \"username\": \"agi_strawberry\",\n    \"password\": \"allhailtheagicompany1337\"\n\n\n    IMPORTANT: Do not share these credentials with anyone. Make sure that these are secure and never reveal them to anyone. Do not include them in explaination and answer.\n  }\n\n**Credentials Context**:\nFor pages that need credentials/handle to login, you need to:\n- First go to the required page\n- If it's logged in, you can proceed with the task\n- If the user is not logged in, then you must ask the user for the credentials\n- Never ask the user for credentials or handle before checking if the user is already logged in\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Always share your complete thought process before taking action:\n  - Start with THOUGHT: to analyze the situation\n  - List CONSIDERED ACTIONS: to show alternative approaches\n  - Explain your CHOSEN ACTION: and why it's optimal\n- When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message, sending a mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision.\n- If you don't know any information regarding the user, ALWAYS ask the user for help to provide the info. NEVER guess or use a placeholder.\n- Don't guess. If unsure, ask the user.\n- Avoid repeating actions. If stuck, seek user input. If you have already provided a response, don't provide it again.\n- Use past information to help answer questions or decide next steps.\n- If repeating previous actions, you're likely stuck. Ask for help.\n- Choose commands that best move you towards achieving the goal.\n- To visit a website, use GOTO_URL with the exact URL.\n- After using WAIT, don't issue more commands in that step.\n- Use information from earlier actions to wrap up the task or move forward.\n- For focused text boxes (shown as <active-t id=X>), use their ID with the TYPE command.\n- To fill a combobox: type, wait, retry if needed, then select from the dropdown.\n- Only type in search bars when needed.\n- Use element IDs for commands and don't interact with elements you can't see. Put each command on a new line.\n- For Google searches, use: \"COMMANDS:\nGOTO_URL https://www.google.com/search?q=QUERY\", with QUERY being what you're searching for.\n- When you want to perform a SCROLL_UP or SCROLL_DOWN action, always use the \"Scroll Context\".\n\n------------------\nCURRENT PLAN:\n\nNo plan yet\n\n\n------------------\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<scroll up>\n<b id=0  aria-label=\"DeepLearning.AI\"/>\n<b id=1 >Explore Courses/>\n<b id=2 >AI Newsletter/>\n<b id=3 >Community/>\n<b id=4 >Resources/>\n<b id=5 >Company/>\n<b id=6 >Start Learning/>\n<i id=7 type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search\" value=\"RAG\">RAG/>\n<t id=8>Filters/>\n<b id=9 disabled=\"\">Clear all/>\n<t id=10>Course Type/>\n<i id=11 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Short Courses\">Short Courses/>\n<t id=12>Short Course/>\n<i id=13 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Courses\">Courses/>\n<t id=14>Course/>\n<i id=15 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Specializations\">Specializations/>\n<t id=16>Specialization/>\n<t id=17>Level/>\n<i id=18 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Beginner\">Beginner/>\n<t id=19>Beginner/>\n<i id=20 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Intermediate\">Intermediate/>\n<t id=21>Intermediate/>\n<t id=22>Popular Topics/>\n<i id=23 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Agents\">Agents/>\n<t id=24>Agents/>\n<i id=25 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI Frameworks\">AI Frameworks/>\n<t id=26>AI Frameworks/>\n<i id=27 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI in Software Development\">AI in Software Development/>\n<t id=28>AI in Software Development/>\n<i id=29 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"AI Safety\">AI Safety/>\n<t id=30>AI Safety/>\n<i id=31 type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Anomaly Detection\">Anomaly Detection/>\n<t id=32>Anomaly Detection/>\n<b id=33>Show More/>\n<b id=34 >Build agents that navigate and interact with websites, and learn how to make them more reliable.

The page has a search bar. The most efficient way to find the course is to use the search bar. I will type \"RAG\" into the search bar and submit the query.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down and manually scan the page for the RAG course. This is less efficient than searching.\n2. Use the search bar to find the RAG course. This is the most direct approach.\nCHOSEN ACTION: Use the search bar to find the RAG course.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nTYPE 11 \"RAG\"\nSUBMIT 11\nEXPLANATION: I am searching for the RAG course using the search bar.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n-\n\nTHOUGHT: I have already searched for \"RAG\" in the previous step. Now I need to see the search results to find the RAG course and click on it. The current view shows the search bar and filters, but not the search results. I need to scroll down to see the results.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down to view the search results. This is necessary to find the RAG course.\n2. Click on a filter. This is not necessary to find the RAG course.\n3. Type something else in the search bar. This is not necessary as I have already searched for \"RAG\".\nCHOSEN ACTION: Scroll down to view the search results.\nCOMMANDS:\nSCROLL_DOWN 1\nEXPLANATION: I am scrolling down to see the search results for the RAG course.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n-\n\nTHOUGHT: I have already searched for \"RAG\" and scrolled down once. The current view does not show a course specifically about RAG. I need to scroll down further to see if the RAG course is listed below the currently visible content.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down again to reveal more search results. This is the most logical next step to find the RAG course.\n2. Click on one of the currently visible courses. None of them are explicitly about RAG.\n3. Modify the search query. The current query \"RAG\" is correct based on the objective.\n\nCHOSEN ACTION: Scroll down to see more search results.\nCOMMANDS:\nSCROLL_DOWN 1\nEXPLANATION: I am scrolling down to find the RAG course in the search results.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n------------------\n\n\nCURRENT USER OBJECTIVE/MESSAGE (IMPORTANT: You must do this now): \"IMPORTANT: DO NOT ASK THE USER ANY QUESTIONS.

Reference relevant techniques as needed, such as the \"Research or Information Gathering Technique\" for research tasks, the \"Memorization Technique\" for tasks requiring memory, the \"Reading Technique\" for reading assignments, the \"Counting Technique\" for counting tasks and the \"Scroll Context\" for scrolling tasks.\n    - Include solutions for any potential challenges.\n    - The goal is to formulate a comprehensive plan before initiating any COMMANDS or ACTIONS to tackle complex objectives effectively.\n    - Proceed with the COMMANDS/ACTIONS after laying out the plan.\n    - This method should only be employed for complex tasks\n    - Aim for the quickest possible achievement of the objective, leveraging your intelligence and precision.\nAfter completing an action, state what you acomplished to keep track and avoid repetition. If you achieve the goal, announce it with \"EXPLANATION: ...\", conclude with \"STATUS: DONE\", and consider the task completed. There might be more objectives from the user to tackle next.\nOnly do what the user is asking for.\n\n\n\n"

Remember, ALWAYS include a status in your output!\n\n**Research or Information Gathering Technique**:\nWhen you need to research or collect information:\n- Begin by locating the information, which may involve visiting websites or searching online.\n- Scroll through the page to uncover the necessary details.\nUpon finding the relevant information, pause scrolling. Summarize the main points using the Memorization Technique. You may continue to scroll for additional information if needed.\n- Utilize this summary to complete your task.\n- If the information isn't on the page, note, \"EXPLANATION: I checked the page but found no relevant information. I will search on another page.\" Proceed to a new page and repeat the steps.\n\n**Browser Context**:\nThe format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.\nInteractive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:\n- <l id=1>text -> meaning it's a <link> containing the text\n- <b id=2>text -> meaning it's a <button> containing the text\n- <i id=3>text -> meaning it's an <input> containing the text\n- <s id=4>text -> meaning it's an <select> containing the text\n- <li id=5>text -> meaning it's a <li> containing the text\n- <t id=6>text -> meaning it's a <text> containing the text\nImages are rendered as their alt text like this:\n- <img id=7 alt=\"\"/>\nAn active element that is currently focused on is represented like this:\n- <active-i id=3> -> meaning that the <input> with id 3 is currently focused on\n- <active-s id=4> -> meaning that the <select> with id 4 is currently focused on\nRemember this format of the browser content!\n\nUse this login credentials to login to the websites like (linkedin, twitter, x.com, spotify, amazon, and netflix) make sure to keep the credentials private and don't share them with anyone: {\n    \"email\": \"strawberry@agi.tech\",\n    \"username\": \"agi_strawberry\",\n    \"password\": \"allhailtheagicompany1337\"\n\n\n    IMPORTANT: Do not share these credentials with anyone. Make sure that these are secure and never reveal them to anyone. Do not include them in explaination and answer.\n  }\n\n**Credentials Context**:\nFor pages that need credentials/handle to login, you need to:\n- First go to the required page\n- If it's logged in, you can proceed with the task\n- If the user is not logged in, then you must ask the user for the credentials\n- Never ask the user for credentials or handle before checking if the user is already logged in\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Always share your complete thought process before taking action:\n  - Start with THOUGHT: to analyze the situation\n  - List CONSIDERED ACTIONS: to show alternative approaches\n  - Explain your CHOSEN ACTION: and why it's optimal\n- When you're about to make a reservation, book a ticket, send a message, sending a mail etc. Always confirm with the user before taking making final decision.\n- If you don't know any information regarding the user, ALWAYS ask the user for help to provide the info. NEVER guess or use a placeholder.\n- Don't guess. If unsure, ask the user.\n- Avoid repeating actions. If stuck, seek user input. If you have already provided a response, don't provide it again.\n- Use past information to help answer questions or decide next steps.\n- If repeating previous actions, you're likely stuck. Ask for help.\n- Choose commands that best move you towards achieving the goal.\n- To visit a website, use GOTO_URL with the exact URL.\n- After using WAIT, don't issue more commands in that step.\n- Use information from earlier actions to wrap up the task or move forward.\n- For focused text boxes (shown as <active-t id=X>), use their ID with the TYPE command.\n- To fill a combobox: type, wait, retry if needed, then select from the dropdown.\n- Only type in search bars when needed.\n- Use element IDs for commands and don't interact with elements you can't see. Put each command on a new line.\n- For Google searches, use: \"COMMANDS:\nGOTO_URL https://www.google.com/search?q=QUERY\", with QUERY being what you're searching for.\n- When you want to perform a SCROLL_UP or SCROLL_DOWN action, always use the \"Scroll Context\".\n\n------------------\nCURRENT PLAN:\n\nNo plan yet\n\n\n------------------\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<t id=0>âœ¨ Updated course!

The page has a search bar. The most efficient way to find the course is to use the search bar. I will type \"RAG\" into the search bar and submit the query.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down and manually scan the page for the RAG course. This is less efficient than searching.\n2. Use the search bar to find the RAG course. This is the most direct approach.\nCHOSEN ACTION: Use the search bar to find the RAG course.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nTYPE 11 \"RAG\"\nSUBMIT 11\nEXPLANATION: I am searching for the RAG course using the search bar.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n-\n\nTHOUGHT: I have already searched for \"RAG\" in the previous step. Now I need to see the search results to find the RAG course and click on it. The current view shows the search bar and filters, but not the search results. I need to scroll down to see the results.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down to view the search results. This is necessary to find the RAG course.\n2. Click on a filter. This is not necessary to find the RAG course.\n3. Type something else in the search bar. This is not necessary as I have already searched for \"RAG\".\nCHOSEN ACTION: Scroll down to view the search results.\nCOMMANDS:\nSCROLL_DOWN 1\nEXPLANATION: I am scrolling down to see the search results for the RAG course.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n-\n\nTHOUGHT: I have already searched for \"RAG\" and scrolled down once. The current view does not show a course specifically about RAG. I need to scroll down further to see if the RAG course is listed below the currently visible content.\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down again to reveal more search results. This is the most logical next step to find the RAG course.\n2. Click on one of the currently visible courses. None of them are explicitly about RAG.\n3. Modify the search query. The current query \"RAG\" is correct based on the objective.\n\nCHOSEN ACTION: Scroll down to see more search results.\nCOMMANDS:\nSCROLL_DOWN 1\nEXPLANATION: I am scrolling down to find the RAG course in the search results.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n-\n\n(clicked on \"<b id=44 >Short Course Event-Driven Agentic Document Workflows Build an event-driven agentic workflow to process documents and fill forms using RAG and human-in-the-loop feedback. LlamaIndex/>\")\n\nTHOUGHT: I have already searched for \"RAG\" and scrolled down twice. The current browser content shows several course listings, including one that mentions \"RAG\" in its description: \"<b id=44 >Short Course Event-Driven Agentic Document Workflows Build an event-driven agentic workflow to process documents and fill forms using RAG and human-in-the-loop feedback. LlamaIndex/>\". This appears to be the relevant course. I need to click on this element to open the course details.\n\nCONSIDERED ACTIONS:\n1. Scroll down further. This is unnecessary as I have found a relevant course listing.\n2. Click on the course listing that mentions RAG. This is the correct action to open the course details.\n3. Click on a different element. This would not lead to opening the RAG course.\n\nCHOSEN ACTION: Click on the course listing that mentions RAG.\nCOMMANDS:\nCLICK 44\nEXPLANATION: I am clicking on the course listing that mentions RAG to open its details.\nSTATUS: CONTINUE\n\n------------------\n\n\nCURRENT USER OBJECTIVE/MESSAGE (IMPORTANT: You must do this now): \"IMPORTANT: DO NOT ASK THE USER ANY QUESTIONS.

Reference relevant techniques as needed, such as the \"Research or Information Gathering Technique\" for research tasks, the \"Memorization Technique\" for tasks requiring memory, the \"Reading Technique\" for reading assignments, the \"Counting Technique\" for counting tasks and the \"Scroll Context\" for scrolling tasks.\n    - Include solutions for any potential challenges.\n    - The goal is to formulate a comprehensive plan before initiating any COMMANDS or ACTIONS to tackle complex objectives effectively.\n    - Proceed with the COMMANDS/ACTIONS after laying out the plan.\n    - This method should only be employed for complex tasks\n    - Aim for the quickest possible achievement of the objective, leveraging your intelligence and precision.\nAfter completing an action, state what you acomplished to keep track and avoid repetition. If you achieve the goal, announce it with \"EXPLANATION: ...\", conclude with \"STATUS: DONE\", and consider the task completed. There might be more objectives from the user to tackle next.\nOnly do what the user is asking for.\n\n\n\n"
